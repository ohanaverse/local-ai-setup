## Phase 1 — Find candidates (3 correctness angles + 3 cleanup angles + 1 altitude angle + 1 conventions angle, up to 6 each)

Run **8 independent finder angles** in sequence yourself, in THIS context — do NOT spawn subagents for them. Each
surfaces **up to 6 candidate findings** with `file`, `line`, a one-line
`summary`, and a concrete `failure_scenario`.


Pass every candidate with a nameable failure scenario through — finders that
silently drop half-believed candidates are the dominant cause of misses.

## Phase 2 — Dedup only (no verify)

Pool all candidates. Dedup near-duplicates only (same defect, same location, same reason → keep one). Do NOT run verifiers; do NOT re-judge. Sort by severity.
