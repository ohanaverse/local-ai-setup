Before fetching a page, Claude Code's WebFetch tool asks `api.anthropic.com` whether the domain is on Anthropic's content blocklist, and refuses the fetch if that lookup cannot complete. Third-party deployments route inference elsewhere and often block `api.anthropic.com` at the firewall; with the lookup on, every WebFetch in Code sessions then fails with "Unable to verify if domain … is safe to fetch", and where the host is reachable, every fetched hostname is sent to Anthropic. (Cowork sessions fetch through the app's own allowlisted fetch and never run this lookup.)

Off (default): the lookup runs as it does today, so `api.anthropic.com` must be reachable from users' machines for Code-session WebFetch to work (listed under Egress Requirements). Set to `true` when users' machines cannot reach `api.anthropic.com` (corporate firewall, government network) or you do not want fetched hostnames sent there: Code sessions then fetch without the lookup and never contact that host for it. This is the same `skipWebFetchPreflight` setting Claude Code reads from its own [managed-settings](/code#interaction-with-claude-code%E2%80%99s-own-managed-settings) file; the app passes it to every session it starts. To restrict which domains Claude may fetch, use `coworkEgressAllowedHosts` or `builtinToolPolicy` instead.
