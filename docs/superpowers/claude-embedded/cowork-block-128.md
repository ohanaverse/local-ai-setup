Free-text instructions from your organization that Claude Desktop appends, in a clearly delimited block, after its own system prompt in **Chat**, **Cowork**, and **Code** (every chat, task, and Code session, including the sub-agents they spawn): for example house style, data-handling rules, or topics to decline. The model is told these instructions come from the organization's administrator and take priority over a user's personal preferences.

This is guidance the model follows, not an enforced control: like any system-prompt text it steers the model's behavior and is usually honored, but it does not guarantee an outcome and is not a substitute for the restriction keys (tool policy, egress allowlist, folder allowlist). The app's own system prompt is never replaced or shortened by this key; in Code sessions it is added after Claude Code's own prompt and any `CLAUDE.md` instructions still apply.

Read from the app's loaded configuration when a session starts; a changed value generally takes effect for sessions started after the next app launch. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed; an empty string is treated as unset. Maximum 3,000 characters; a longer value is rejected (the key is ignored with a configuration error) rather than truncated. Line breaks are preserved when the value is delivered as JSON, a bootstrap response, a `.mobileconfig` profile, or a `.reg` file; the Group Policy (ADMX) and Intune text box for this setting is single-line.
