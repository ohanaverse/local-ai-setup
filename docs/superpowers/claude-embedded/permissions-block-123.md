Server-derived: the Claude.ai control plane sets this key, each time it serves the configuration, from the organization's Claude in Chrome setting (Admin settings → Claude in Chrome — the same switch, site allowlist/blocklist, and per-role access that govern the extension itself) and the signed-in member's role. It is not authored in any form, MDM profile, or bootstrap server, and a value stored anywhere else is ignored.

When on, Cowork and Code sessions can use the Claude in Chrome browser tools (navigate, read page, click, type, screenshot) in the user's Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Tool calls travel over the browser's local native-messaging connection between the app and the extension and are encrypted end to end between the two; page content is never relayed through Anthropic servers, and inference stays on the configured provider; the extension's hosted URL-safety check stays on, so the address of each page the agent acts on is checked against the Anthropic API. macOS and Windows only.

Before any tool call, Claude Desktop and the extension each obtain a short-lived signed identity statement from the Anthropic API and pair only when both belong to the same account in your organization, so those two small requests do go to Anthropic. Installed from the Chrome Web Store, the extension runs in third-party mode on its own for members of a hybrid organization — nothing runs that does not arrive over the verified pairing, and per-site permission prompts are delegated to Claude Desktop — so no separate Chrome policy is needed. Chrome managed policy stays optional for locked-down fleets: `forceLoginOrgUUID` may name the organization(s) allowed to take control of the extension wherever the policy reaches (a Claude Desktop from any other organization is refused), and `blockedUrlPatterns` may be added and applies on top of the hosted URL-safety check. Requires `isLocalDevMcpEnabled` to remain enabled. Off unless the organization's Claude in Chrome setting is on.
