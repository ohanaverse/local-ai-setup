Render a clickable role-picker chip row during Cowork onboarding. Call this when asking the user what kind of work they do so they can pick their role and get a matching plugin installed. The role list is hardcoded in the frontend — call with no args.

The call blocks until the user responds. Three resolution paths all land in the tool result: chip click or free-form typed answer → {"role": "Legal"} or {"role": "paralegal"}; X button → {"dismissed": true}. An empty object {} means the user approved without picking a role — treat it like a dismissal. Free-form roles may not match the chip list — search the marketplace with whatever string you get.

Do NOT call this in normal conversation. Only call this when explicitly helping the user set up Cowork for their role/job function.
