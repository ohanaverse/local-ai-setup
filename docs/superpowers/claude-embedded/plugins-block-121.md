For `git` sources, the HTTPS remote the app clones. For `url` sources, the HTTPS address of a `marketplace.json` whose plugins are `archive` entries (a zip `url` plus its `sha256`; `ref` and `path` do not apply). Archive URLs must be same-origin with the manifest URL: that origin is the only host to open on the firewall and the only one a credential is sent to. If any archive fails to download or verify, nothing from that fetch is installed and the next sync retries.

When Installation is `auto_install` or `required`, set `manifestSha256` to the SHA-256 of that exact file and give every archive a `sha256`: a served manifest with a different digest is refused and unpinned archives are skipped, so publishing a new manifest means updating `manifestSha256`. A marketplace served from your inference gateway's or bootstrap server's own origin may instead leave Installation at `available` and mark individual plugins `"installationPreference": "auto_install"` in the manifest (each with a `sha256`); those install with no pin and a new manifest is picked up on the periodic re-fetch. On any other origin the per-plugin marks are ignored.

`credentialKind` selects what is sent: `anonymous` (the default) nothing, `userGit` the user's stored git credential for that host as HTTP Basic, `credentialHelper` the helper's output as `Authorization`, and `inferenceCredential` (`url` sources only) the credential the app already sends your inference gateway or enabled bootstrap server, so the manifest must be on one of those two origins; when there is nothing to send yet, no request is made and the entry reports why. See [Host the marketplace over HTTPS](/extensions#host-the-marketplace-over-https-instead-of-git) for an example manifest and credential details.
