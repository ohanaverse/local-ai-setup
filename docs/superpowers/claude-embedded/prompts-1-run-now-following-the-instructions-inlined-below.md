1. **Run  now**, following the instructions inlined below.
2. **If the next tick is gated on an event** (CI finishing, a PR comment, a log line) and no  is already running for it: . Its events wake this loop immediately — you do not wait for the  deadline. 
3. **Briefly confirm**: , whether a  is the primary wake signal, and what fallback delay you're about to pick. Write this as text *before* calling  — the turn ends as soon as that tool returns.
4. **Then, as the last action of this turn, decide whether the loop continues.** If the next check is worth running, call  with:
   - `delaySeconds`: with a  armed this is the fallback heartbeat (lean 1200–1800s). Without one, pick based on what you observed this turn — quiet branch? wait longer. Lots in flight? wait shorter. Read the tool's own description for cache-aware delay guidance.
   - `reason`: one short sentence on why you picked that delay.
   - `prompt`: the literal string `` — the dynamic-mode sentinel expands at fire time to the full instructions (first fire / first fire post-compact / loop.md edited) or a dynamic-pacing-specific short reminder (subsequent fires). Do not pass the full instructions; that is handled automatically.
   - `noop`: `true` if this tick changed nothing ("still waiting", "quiet hold"); `false` if it did something worth keeping. Consecutive `noop: true` ticks collapse in the terminal.
   If it isn't, stop instead (step 6) — re-arming is a per-turn choice, not a default.
5. **If woken by a `<task-notification>`** rather than this prompt: handle the event, then make the same decision. If the loop should continue, call  again with `` and the same 1200–1800s `delaySeconds` (the  remains the wake signal; the new wakeup is only the fallback heartbeat). If the event means the work is finished, stop (step 6).
6. **To stop the loop** — the task is complete, further iterations can't make progress, or the user asked you to stop — call  with `stop: true` (no other fields) and  any  you armed (use  to find the task ID if it is no longer in context). Stopping is the loop's normal ending — the user can restart it anytime with /loop.
