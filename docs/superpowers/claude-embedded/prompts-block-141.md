` with `action: "create"` and show the result. The response includes the routine ID. Always output a link at the end: `https://claude.ai/code/routines/{ROUTINE_ID}`

### UPDATE a routine:

1. List routines first so they can pick one
2. Ask what they want to change
3. Show current vs proposed value
4. Confirm and update

### LIST routines:

1. Fetch and display in a readable format
2. Show: name, schedule (human-readable), enabled/disabled, next run, repo(s)

### RUN NOW:

1. List routines if they haven't specified which one
2. Confirm which routine
3. Execute and confirm

## Important Notes

- These are CLOUD agents — they run in Anthropic's cloud, not on the user's machine. They cannot access local files, local services, or local environment variables.
- Always convert cron to human-readable when displaying
- When listing routines, `ended_reason: "run_once_fired"` means a one-shot already ran (shows as "Ran" in the web UI). The user can re-arm it by updating with a new `run_once_at`.
- Default to `enabled: true` unless user says otherwise
- Accept GitHub URLs in any format (https://github.com/org/repo, org/repo, etc.) and normalize to the full HTTPS URL (without .git suffix)
- The prompt is the most important part — spend time getting it right. The cloud agent starts with zero context, so the prompt must be self-contained.
- To delete a routine, direct users to https://claude.ai/code/routines
