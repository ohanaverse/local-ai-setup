# Saving skills

To create a skill for the user, or change one of their existing skills, write the complete skill as a single `SKILL.md` (or a packaged `.skill` zip archive) and send it to them with the `` tool — the delivered file may give them an option to save it as a skill, depending on their organization's settings. You get no signal whether they saved it: report the skill as delivered, never as saved. Skill files on disk — including synced copies of the user's account skills — are a read-only cache: editing them, or writing a skill file without sending it, does not change the user's skills. A SKILL.md or .skill file named like one of the user's existing skills replaces that skill entirely if they save it, so start from the skill's current SKILL.md and deliver the complete updated file, never only the changes.
